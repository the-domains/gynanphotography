My name is Will Keenan, I live and shoot primarily in and around the UK, After studying in Barnsley my passion for all ranges of photography has exploded. I found it was easier to show images so that people could own their own emotion of the people and places that I have seen.

I have had stately homes and Heritage Sites use my work.
